# Qstrich
A powerful yet minimal tool for developers to store, manage, and quickly retrieve tech notes and commands.

## Motivation
I love Linux and coding, and I'm always taking on new challenges. However, I realized that I constantly forget where I saved my notes or the things I researched, which leads me to repeat the same investigations over and over again.

I wanted to consolidate everything in one place, but Google Keep is difficult to edit and doesn’t support Markdown. I also tried managing notes locally with Vim and searching them using a fuzzy finder, but if the files weren’t on my machine, I couldn’t do anything. Naturally, searching from a different device was out of the question.

This year, I decided to learn Go, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to build something useful. Please forgive me if this project is still rough around the edges.
